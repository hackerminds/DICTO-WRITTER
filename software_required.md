# GET THE SYSTEM IMAGE
The Voice Kit requires a special version of the Raspbian operating system that includes some extra AIY software. So before you begin, you need to download the Voice Kit system image and flash it to your MicroSD card.

1.  Download the latest  `.img.xz`  file from the  [releases page on GitHub](https://github.com/google/aiyprojects-raspbian/releases).
2.  Use an adapter to connect your MicroSD card to your computer.
3.  Use a program such as  [Etcher](https://etcher.io/)  to flash the  `.img.xz`  file onto your MicroSD card. (Etcher is free and works on Windows, Mac OS, and Linux.)
